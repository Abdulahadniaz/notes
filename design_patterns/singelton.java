/*
 * Singleton:
 * This design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class
 * and ensures that there is only one instance of the class in the JVM.
 * 
 * This is useful when you want to control the number of instances of a class
 * that can be created, or when you want to ensure that a class has a single
 * point of access.
 * 
 * The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of
 * the class.
 * 
 * Useful for logging, drivers objects, caching, and thread pool.
 * 
 * JAVA singleton pattern Implementation:
 * 
 * There are multiple ways to implement the singleton pattern in Java.
 * 
 * 1- Eager Initialization
 * 2- Static block initialization
 * 3- Lazy Initialization
 * 4- Thread Safe Singleton
 * 5- Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation
 * 
 * All these methods have few things in common:
 * 1- Private constructor
 * 2- Private static variable
 * 3- Public static method to get the instance of the class(global access point)
 * 
 */

/*
 * 1 - Eager Initialization:
 * 
 * Eager initialization of singleton class creates the instance of the class
 * when it is being loaded. he drawback is that instance is created even if
 * it is not needed.
 * 
 * If the singelton class is not using too much resources, this is a good.

// ============================================

/*
 * 2 - Static block initialization:
 * 
 * Static block initialization of singleton class is similar to eager
 * initialization,
 * except that instance of class is created in the static block that provides
 * the
 * option for exception handling.
 * 
 * Both eager initialization and static block initialization create the instance
 * even before itâ€™s being used and that is not the best practice to use.

/*
 * 3 - Lazy Initialization:
 * 
 * Lazy initialization of singleton class is when the instance of the class
 * is created in the global access method.
 * But this method doesn't provide thread safety.
 * If there is a single thread based app, this is a good approach.
 * But in multi-threaded and distributed environment, this is not a good
 * approach.
 * Because each thread will create its own instance of the class.
 * And this destroys the singleton paattern

/*
 * Thread Safe Initialization:
 * 
 * Thread safe initialization of singleton class is when the
 * gloabl access method is synchronized.
 * 
 * But this method is expensive because of the cost associated with the
 * synchronized method, and it reduces the performance of your program.
 * 
 * To avoid this, we have double checked locking principle.
 * In this approach, the synchronized block is used inside the if condition with
 * an additional check to ensure that only one instance of a singleton class is
 * created
